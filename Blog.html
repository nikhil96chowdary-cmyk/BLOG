  <p>
    For a long time, I believed that being online anywhere was better than not being online at all — that visibility, in any form, was inherently beneficial. Like many emerging and mid-career artists, I felt an unspoken pressure to say yes: yes to platforms, yes to opportunities, yes to being “seen,” even when something didn’t quite feel right.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, it became clear that where your work is seen matters just as much as whether it is seen at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    Online platforms are never neutral. They shape how work is encountered, how it is interpreted, and how artists are positioned. Some spaces quietly support a practice. Others dilute it, rush it, or strip away its context. This post is written for UK artists who want to make more considered choices about where they place their work — without guilt, haste, or pressure.

  <h2>Being Seen vs Being Truly Looked At</h2>

  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496317899792-9d7dbcd928a1" alt="Person quietly observing artwork">

  <p>Not all visibility is meaningful.</p>

  <p>
    Before placing work on a platform, it’s worth pausing to ask: who is actually here? Is the space designed for collectors, institutions, peers, or simply anyone scrolling past?
  </p>

  <p>
    It also matters whether the audience is UK-based or international, whether pricing expectations align with your practice, and whether engagement feels thoughtful or purely transactional. A large audience counts for very little if no one is really paying attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Being widely visible is not the same as being genuinely seen.

  <h2>Why Curation Matters More Than We’re Told</h2>

  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1500336624523-d727130c3328" alt="Minimal curated exhibition space">

  <p>Curation isn’t about exclusivity — it’s about care.</p>

  <p>
    When work sits alongside everything and anything, it can lose its voice. Platforms with no selection process, no editorial framing, and no sense of coherence often weaken the work they host, even if unintentionally.
  </p>

  <p>It’s worth asking:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Is there a clear review or selection process?</li>
    <li>Does the work on the platform feel considered and consistent?</li>
    <li>Are artists given space to be understood through statements, text, or context?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Good curation doesn’t shout. It quietly supports.</p>
</section>

  <h2>Money, Fees, and Feeling Clear — Not Confused</h2>

  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165804606-c3d57bc86b40" alt="Documents and contracts on desk">

  <p>
    The financial side of online platforms can feel uncomfortable to discuss, but clarity here is essential.
  </p>

  <p>Before committing your work, you deserve to understand:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What fees or commission are involved</li>
    <li>When and how payments are made</li>
    <li>Whether there are hidden or optional costs</li>
    <li>How long your work is committed, and how you can leave</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If terms feel vague, overly complex, or difficult to access, that uncertainty tends to surface later — often at the worst possible moment.
  </p>

  <p>Transparency isn’t a luxury. It’s a basic professional standard.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Support Isn’t a Bonus — It’s a Signal</h2>

  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521737604893-d14cc237f11d" alt="Professional conversation between two people">

  <p>
    Support looks different everywhere, but its absence is usually noticeable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some platforms offer a genuine point of contact, thoughtful promotion, or guidance around presentation and pricing. Others simply upload work and disappear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many artists only discover the true level of support when something goes wrong — a question, a delay, a problem. How a platform responds in those moments reveals far more than polished promises ever could.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Knowing What’s Actually Happening</h2>

  <p>
    Without insight, it’s difficult to know whether a platform is working for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even basic information — views, enquiries, or patterns over time — helps artists make informed decisions about their practice. A complete lack of feedback leaves artists guessing, and guessing rarely supports confidence, growth, or long-term sustainability.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Protecting Your Work and Your Rights</h2>

  <p>Your work is yours.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You retain copyright</li>
    <li>Image usage is clearly defined</li>
    <li>Rights are not open-ended or perpetual</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If a platform asks for more control than it genuinely needs, it’s worth pausing and asking why.
  </p>
</section>

<hr>

<section>
  <h2>The Environment Matters Too</h2>

  <p>
    The tone of a platform — how it communicates, moderates, and treats people — shapes your experience as much as its audience or reach.
  </p>

  <p>Consider whether:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Content and communication are respectfully moderated</li>
    <li>Accessibility and inclusion are taken seriously</li>
    <li>There is a clear way to raise concerns or complaints</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These factors directly affect trust, safety, and how supported you feel placing your work there.
  </p>
</section>

<hr>

<section>
  <h2>A Few Quiet Red Flags</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Prioritises quantity over care</li>
    <li>Uses contracts that are hard to understand</li>
    <li>Charges high fees without clear value</li>
    <li>Cannot clearly explain who it is for or why it exists</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Walking away is not failure. It is discernment.</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section>
  <h2>A Simple Check-In Before You Say Yes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Does this audience feel right for where I am now?</li>
    <li>Are the terms clear, fair, and accessible?</li>
    <li>Is my work presented with care and respect?</li>
    <li>Do I retain control of my images and rights?</li>
    <li>Does this support the artist I am becoming — not just the work I am uploading?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If too many answers feel uneasy, trust that feeling.</p>
